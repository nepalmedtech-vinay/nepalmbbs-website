# NEXT_TASK.md

_Read this file first in a new session, after `PROJECT_STATE.md`. It is
overwritten at the end of every chunk to point at the next one._

## Status as of the end of this session's Phase 0

`npm run verify` was run for the first time in this container. It could
not run at all until three real bugs were fixed (see `DECISION_LOG.md`):
a missing `playwright` devDependency, three test files hardcoding a dead
absolute path, and a missing git tag a test asserts against. All three
are fixed. See `QA_REPORT.md` for the actual pass/fail results once the
run this session started has finished and been recorded there — if that
file still shows the run as in-progress, finish reading its output before
starting new feature work, since a red suite changes what "safe to build
on" means.

## Design: premium pass in progress (2026-08-28)

The owner asked for a premium look and for work to continue in chunks
without stopping for approval. Done so far, each verified by screenshotting
at 390px before and after:

- ✅ **Contact bar and ticker** — these still had hard-coded *dark*
  backgrounds from the pre-Phase-3 build while `bridge.css` had flipped
  their text to dark ink. Dark on dark: the two phone numbers were
  effectively invisible. Rebuilt in `public/assets/theme/chrome.css`.
- ✅ **Fixed-header overlap** — the 69px navbar covered the first element
  of *every* page at 390px (18–25px). Raised the mobile padding floor; all
  seven routes re-measured clear.
- ✅ **Admin button hidden from the public** (`chrome.js`) — shown only on
  an existing staff session or `#admin`. Cannot lock the owner out.
- ✅ **Floating buttons 3 → 2** — the WhatsApp-call floater duplicated what
  the contact bar now offers at full size.
- ✅ **Footer** — emoji list markers (📞📲💬✉️) replaced with inline SVG;
  disclaimer restyled from a ⚠️ line into a proper standing note.
- ✅ **New `/404`** — there was none.
- ✅ **New `/privacy`** — there was none, on a site that collects a
  student's name, phone, NEET score, city, category and marks bands.
  Written from what the code does. **Needs the owner to supply two things**
  it deliberately refuses to invent: the registered legal entity, and the
  data retention period. Both are flagged on the page itself.
- ✅ **The font nobody loaded** — 41 rules asked for `Sora` and 5 for
  `Inter`; neither is loaded, so the logo, every heading, card title,
  button, statistic and college name fell back to the device's system
  sans. Only the home-page hero escaped it. Mapped onto the design
  system's own faces. This was the largest single cause of the site
  reading as generic.
- ✅ **Counseling page** — same dark-slab bug as the contact bar, on the
  most commercially important page: its headline rendered black on
  near-black. Now light, readable, and consistent with every other route.

### Design skill

`.claude/skills/` now vendors two SKILL.md files from
github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill (MIT), at the owner's request — reviewed
before adoption, methodology only, no scripts. Its audit is a good
checklist for the remaining passes.

### Not yet done from that audit

- Section interiors are still flat — the skill's "empty, flat sections with
  no visual depth" applies to several content pages.
- `.foot-top` is still a four-column link farm.
- Shadows are neutral rather than hue-tinted.
- Headline `text-wrap: balance` is only partly applied.
- The three-equal-cards pattern appears on a few pages.

## Deploy status (2026-08-28)

The owner asked for the Netlify deploy to be done for them, without any
manual steps on their side. Before deploying, the `docs/GOLIVE.md`
prerequisites were checked **directly against the live database** rather
than asked about, and all pass:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `staff` rows with `role='admin'` | 1 — no admin-lockout risk |
| `sequence_steps` seeded | 7 — follow-up tasks will materialise |
| public tables with RLS off | 0 |
| `leads` row-level security | on — student contact data is not publicly readable |

So GOLIVE steps 1 (migrations) and 2 (first staff account) were already
done before this session. The deploy is therefore the documented step 3.

Netlify site: `nepalmbbs` / `fac99d5b-96f8-4ff9-a9da-a34b962a7d13`,
primary URL `https://nepalmbbs.in`.

**Caveat worth carrying forward:** the Netlify MCP `deploy-site`
operation takes only a `siteId` — it exposes no draft/preview flag, so a
deploy through it cannot be guaranteed to stay off production. The
repo's own `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` prefers a branch deploy or deploy preview
first. If a future session needs a genuine preview, use the Netlify CLI
(`netlify deploy` without `--prod`) rather than this tool.

## College data: what got fixed, and what is still open

Two research passes ran (see `CONTENT_SOURCE_LOG.md` for full sourcing).
The second pass restricted search to each institution's **own website**,
which is what the applied fixes rest on.

### ✅ Fixed in `src/data/colleges.json`

- **A wrong institution name** — "Universal Medicine College" →
  **"Universal College of Medical Sciences"**, per ucms.edu.np itself.
  Also filled its `established` (1998) and `website`.
- **CMS Bharatpur `established`** 1994 → **1993**, per cmsnepal.edu.np
  (agreement signed 8 Aug 1993). Their first MBBS intake was 1996 — both
  dates are recorded in the log so this isn't "corrected" back by mistake.
- **Two missing official websites** filled (NAIHS, Rapti AHS).

### ❌ A flag that turned out to be wrong (worth reading before you trust the rest)

The first pass claimed PAHS's `established: 2010` was wrong because
secondary sources said 2008. **That was my error.** PAHS's own site says
teaching began in 2010; 2008 is the charter year. Both are true, they
just mean different things. Value left unchanged.

The lesson matters for the remaining blanks: an aggregator's
"established" year may be measuring a different milestone than this
dataset means. Do not bulk-fill them.

### ⚠️ Still open — needs MEC or a phone call, not more searching

1. **Kathmandu Medical College foreign-quota seats** — site says 43, one
   secondary source says 33. KMC's own site doesn't publish the number.
2. **Pokhara Academy (PoAHS)** — *downgraded from the earlier alarm.*
   Their own site does have an MBBS page, so the program appears to
   exist; the "launching by 2024" text that worried me is stale content
   on a different domain of theirs. What's still unconfirmed is whether
   it takes **foreign-quota** students and whether "4 seats" is right.
3. **NAIHS `established`** — still blank. Two defensible dates (2010
   ministry approval, 2012 inauguration); left blank rather than guessed.
4. **7 other blank `established` fields** — candidates exist in the log
   but only from aggregators. Left alone deliberately (see the PAHS
   lesson above).
5. **Three MBBS programs are brand new** — B&C (2024), MIHS (2024),
   Madan Bhandari (2025) — and the site doesn't say so. Surfacing "first
   intake YYYY" would fit the existing trust-register design and is
   arguably owed to a family comparing a first-intake program against a
   30-year-old one.

## Done since this file was last written

- ✅ **Removed dead code**: `src/components/Hero.astro` (confirmed
  unused anywhere — zero imports found by search) and the boot.js step
  that called it, `wrapHeroContent()`/`initHeroSlideshow()`, neither of
  which exist anywhere in the codebase. This ran, threw, and was silently
  swallowed on **every single page load, site-wide**, since whenever the
  functions were removed — invisible to `build-verify.mjs` because it
  only listens for uncaught `pageerror`, not `console.error`. Full verify
  suite re-run after this change; see `QA_REPORT.md`.
- ✅ **First-pass content-sourcing research, all 27 colleges** — see
  `CONTENT_SOURCE_LOG.md` for the per-college tables with sources.
  Done via `WebSearch` only (`WebFetch` is blocked in this sandbox for
  every domain tried, including MEC Nepal's own site). Found 1 wrong
  name, 2 wrong-looking years, 1 conflicting seat count, 1 program whose
  existence couldn't be confirmed, 3 undisclosed brand-new programs, and
  9 fillable blanks. Nothing auto-corrected — see the 🔴 section above.
- ✅ **College comparison tool** — `src/pages/colleges/compare.astro` +
  `public/assets/js/compare.js`, linked from `/colleges`. Pick up to 4
  colleges, compare the exact fields already published on each college's
  own page (nothing new, nothing estimated). Verified by
  `tests/compare-verify.mjs` (13/13), wired into `npm run verify`. See
  `DECISION_LOG.md`'s 2026-08-28 entry for why it was built this way.
- ⛔ **Fee/cost planner — do not build this** without re-reading
  `DECISION_LOG.md`'s 2026-08-28 entry first. The codebase has an existing,
  deliberate, already-written editorial decision *not* to publish fee
  figures (`colleges/index.astro` and `colleges/[slug].astro` both say so,
  in their own copy, not just in these memory files). A calculator would
  reverse that decision, not fill a gap — and this session did not have
  the standing to make that call unilaterally on the owner's behalf.
  Revisit only if the owner explicitly decides to change that policy.

## Recommended next chunk, in order

1. **Work the 🔴 list above** — resolve each against a primary source
   (the college's own site, or MEC Nepal), then correct
   `src/data/colleges.json` and record the confirmation in
   `CONTENT_SOURCE_LOG.md`. Items 1 and 2 (PoAHS's program, the wrong
   college name) carry real "a family could be misled right now" risk;
   the rest are accuracy debt.

2. Re-check whether the three legacy glass-CSS variants noted in
   `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` §4 are actually dead now that the Phase 3/4
   theme engine exists, or still shipping (see `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`).
   Quick, bounded, good "in-between" chunk if 1–2 are blocked.

4. A deadline/announcement center (brief §10.H) is still a real gap and
   still needs real dates from an official source before it can exist —
   same rule as fees: no invented dates, ever.

## What NOT to do without asking

- Do not build a fee/cost calculator or publish any fee figure — see
  "Done since this file was last written" above. This is now the second
  time it's written down; treat it as settled, not open.

- Do not touch `supabase/migrations/`, apply a migration, or change RLS
  policy — this is database access the brief itself flags as needing
  explicit care, and `docs/GOLIVE.md` is the only source of truth for
  sequencing that.
- Do not deploy, connect Netlify, or point production at this branch.
  Nothing here goes live until the owner explicitly says so — this is
  stated directly in the session's own operating instructions, not just
  inferred caution.
- Do not remove `public/wrc-tracker/` or `public/cmc-tracker/`, or change
  their CSP — they're deliberately untouched, verbatim legacy apps.
- Do not fabricate college fees, seat counts, deadlines, or recognition
  status to fill a gap. Mark as unverified/estimated instead, and log it
  in `CONTENT_SOURCE_LOG.md`.
